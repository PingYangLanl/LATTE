*************************** The 'README' for GPU-enabled LATTE  **************************

To compile the CUDA code written by Ed Sanville you must first install on your machine NVIDIA's CUDA SDK. See: http://developer.nvidia.com/page/tools.html

The only place where one can really make changes in the MATRIX/Makefile is where the compute capability is specified. Fermis are CC 2.0 while Teslas are CC 1.3

Enjoy maximizing your FLOPS/W and FLOPS/$!
